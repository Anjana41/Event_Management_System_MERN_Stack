Currently in AICTE Event/Activity Management happens manually. Such examples of activities that happen manually are Booking of meeting room/auditorium, communication 
to all the bureaus/members regarding meetings through email and SMS alerts, intimate canteen for refreshment/Lunch/dinner arrangements, update the information on AICTE social media like Facebook & Twitter page, Report generation, activity log checking etc. This manual process generally takes a lot of time to implement and can cause delay to the actual work. With the fast-growing network of AICTE, it needs to automate its process to provide ease to manual work. This can highly increase in economic growth of AICTE and manage all events very smoothly with all information to have directed to one single portal. Summary:  Due to manually management of Events AICTE faces a lot of challenges where they lose a lot of time to gather all the events together.

Create a common portal for all AICTE Event/Activity management would ease you their work and make the work process robust and flexible. This will ensure AICTE to have all events under one umbrella from where the management would be easy and comfortable.
